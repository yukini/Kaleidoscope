Things inside this directory are tools and scripts intended for interactive testing with a specific device attached. At this time, they're not intended for automated testing under CI.

Things that might be here include tests of the focus protocol or tests of on-device EEPROM/Storage.

These tests may require locally installed tools.

(There are dragons in this directory and we deemed it better to keep this stuff around in the hopes of eventually getting it automated than throwing it away.)
